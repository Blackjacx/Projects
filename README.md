# My Projects

This repo builds a DocC documentation for a Swift package that contains a DocC Catalog. The catalog shows a list of all of my projects. Each time something is pushed to `main` the website is deployed to GitHub Pages. You can visit the final website under https://blackjacx.github.io/Projects/.

## Using the Swift Package

To build the DocC archive, which can be imported and used directly in Xcode's local documentation tool, just open the `Package.swift` file, and select Product > Build Documentation.
